You might encounter this error while trying to install the pg gem (v0.10.1), or when updating from v0.10.

My stacktrace on Mac OS X Snow Leopard 10.6.6 with Rubygems 1.4.2, Ruby 1.8.7 and Postgres 9.0.2 was the following:

    
    Building native extensions.  This could take a while...
    ERROR:  Error installing pg:

    Could not create Makefile due to some reason, probably lack of
    necessary libraries and/or headers.  Check the mkmf.log file for more
    details.  You may need configuration options.



Oookay, so let's try to find out what's going wrong. A quick Google search shows that errors like this one happens on Linux too, and usually suggests that ARCHFLAGS definitions may be a problem. Indeed, /Library/Ruby/Gems/1.8/gems/pg-0.10.1/ext/mkmf.log contains this error message:

    
    ld: warning: in /usr/local/Cellar/postgresql/9.0.2/lib/libpq.dylib, file was built for unsupported file format which is not the architecture being linked (i386)



The problem seems to come from the way [Homebrew](https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew) installs Postgres.

Homebrew install notes include the following informative message:

    
    If you want to install the postgres gem, including ARCHFLAGS is recommended:
        env ARCHFLAGS="-arch x86_64" gem install pg



There! Now the only problem is if you install your gems as root, you can't merely put a sudo before the "gem", but you have to sudo su then execute the command:

    
    Air:~ florent$ sudo su
    Password:
    sh-3.2# env ARCHFLAGS="-arch x86_64" gem install pg
    Building native extensions.  This could take a while...

Voil√†!

**Edit 18 Dec.** Chad provided a simpler solution in the comments that doesn't require you to log in as root and works just as well:

    
    sudo env ARCHFLAGS="-arch x86_64" gem install pg
