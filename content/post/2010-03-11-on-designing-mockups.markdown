As part of a group project, I am currently involved in designing an application from the ground up. Designing the UI first drafts, before even chosing a programming language or environment, is something that should be easy and straightforward. We needed a tool that allows easy sharing between people, regardless of operating system.

Please welcome [Mockingbird](http://gomockingbird.com/mockingbird/).

An amazing web application to design sleek and elegant UIs, Mockingbird is Javascript-based (no Flash!) and especially powerful if you're working as part of a team or if you share a lot of mockups. Try it!
