Tunalysis development is doing good, as sporadic as it may be. The next step is to rework/refine the algorithm giving rankings, in order to achieve better results. I'll try to include the "Last Played Date" in the mix, and maybe also use the Date Added.

More good news: no need to install gems by yourself anymore, everything's included by [Bundler](http://gembundler.com/).
