Just a quick follow-up to [this post about changing application icons](/blog/2010/changing-an-application-icon-under-os-x/):

* Someone actually found this post by Googling for "creepy preview icon osx". I love it. :D
* You can find an astonishing number of great icons on [DeviantArt](http://www.deviantart.com/). There is actually a [whole category for Mac OS X icons](http://browse.deviantart.com/customization/icons/os/mac/), and given DeviantArt usual level of quality, most of these are insanely good.

Hats off to [this nifty little customization for nostalgic users](http://tiashi.deviantart.com/art/Apple-Rainbow-Logo-4-Mac-OS-X-170459875?q=boost:popular+in:customization/icons/os/mac+max_age:744h&qo=70) by the way. Not an icon stricto sensu, but definitely lovely.
