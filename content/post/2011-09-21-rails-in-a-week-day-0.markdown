Tl;dr: I'm learning Rails in a week! And I'll blog about it all along. Any tips?




## So. Learning Rails.


As a recent graduate in CS, moving to a new country in two weeks and looking forward to expand my skills, Rails looks like a good fit: it's in demand, it focuses on developer happiness, vibrant ecosystem yadda yadda. You probably already know this so let's cut the marketing speak!


## Methodology


My main aim is to get familiar with the Rails ecosystem, but also to learn better processes in the way. This includes a more thorough use of version control, testing, server provisioning and deployment.

I plan on using the following tools:



	  * Git (I already know a bit of git, but basically just add/commit/push to Github. We'll see if I need more)
	  * Vagrant & Chef to provision the VM
	  * Capistrano to deploy
	  * Test::Unit
	  * Cucumber
	  * RailsForZombies as a very first introduction

The plan is to spend about 8 hours a day for 7 days, including a day off on Sunday and time off when Rugby World Cup matches are on the telly (I'm not a bot!).

I'm not yet settled on using the Pomodoro technique, we'll see how things work out.


## Goal


My objective at the end of this week is to create a small webapp that will give you a map showing the antipodes of something the user entered (a city, a country, etc). The logic behind this isn't very complicated at first glance: plug into Google Maps and revert GPS coordinates? Which makes it a good learning project.


## Caveat/Gotchas


I already know Ruby (not inside and out, but a fair bit of it), which will undoubtedly make the learning process easier. I also wrote a few websites using Sinatra, so I have a basic awareness of what Rack is, how HAML works, etc - it's not as if I was beginning from zero.

Of course, I won't have time to learn all there is to know about Rails in a mere seven days. :) But I have to get started somewhere, get something done, and I hope I'll be able to reduce the number of unknown unknowns I have about Rails as much as possible in that timeframe.

I have listed more tools centered around ops than in Rails itself because I don't know much about what will take time right now. That's where I'm looking for your help: do you have pointers for things I should learn? Things I should absolutely do/absolutely not do? Feel free to post them here, [on Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3023901), or fire me an email.



Learning begins tomorrow at 8!
