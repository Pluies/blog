So, [remaildr.com](http://remaildr.com) had been in a pretty sorry state for a couple of months now, and I kept thinking I should go have a look into it and get to the bottom of the issue.

And the bottom of the issue was the 6000 spam emails sitting in the inbox, making the server crash at startup.

They're now deleted, and everything is back up and happy. I'm currently thinking about different monitoring options, but given it's all email-based, no solution that I know of seem overly practical to me. Any idea would be appreciated. :)
