So... Turns out there is no shortcut to turn text to semibold in Apple Pages, from the iWork suite. There are shortcuts for **bold** and _italic_ respectively, but not semibold (or light / ultralight for that matter) even for the fonts that support it.

The closest thing to a solution that I found is through Character Style:
- Select a piece of text, make it semibold
- In the **Styles Drawer**, under **Character Styles**, click on the little arrow next to "none" and "**Create New Character Style From Selection**"
- Assign a **Hot Key** to the newly created Character Style, by clicking the arrow next to it and Hot Key.

There are a few drawbacks to this approach, mainly that the character style you're defining will be tied to a particular font, and that the only shortcuts allowed by the Hot Key setting are F1 to F6. If anyone has a better way, I'm all ears!
