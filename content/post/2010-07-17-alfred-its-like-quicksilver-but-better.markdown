I recently started to use [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/), first along [Quicksilver](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksilver_%28software%29), then as a full replacement. For those of you who never used any of these two, they act like Spotlight on steroids: invoke them with a shortcut, type in a few letters, and let the fun begin. Quicksilver lets you do the basics (launch programs, open folders...) and [way, way more](http://lifehacker.com/249085/hack-attack-advanced-quicksilver-guide-+-slashes-appends-and-proxies-oh-my).

A simple example? You can type a picture name, then use Quicksilver to resize it at your will, then re-invoke Quicksilver to send it to someone in your Address Book. That's already pretty impressive, but the amazing part is being able to do it all from the keyboard. Command-line gurus (and to be honest, even command-line regular users :) ) know that using the mouse is usually a waste of time.

However, Quicksilver development seemed to have stopped. [Blacktree](http://www.blacktree.com/), QS developers (check out Nocturne, it's awesome!), hasn't given any sign of life for quite some time. Some development seems to be going on on GitHub, but nothing ground-breaking.

Considering I don't use most of Quicksilver's possibilities, and that I felt QS was getting slower and slower (an index-related issue maybe?), I tried Alfred.

Alfred is **fast**. **Blazing fast**. It's especially impressive on a MacBook Air, with its slow-ish processor and sluggish hard drive.

Considering I use it often to launch programs and web searches (you can add you own search engines), the speed improvement is what sold me. Check it out!
