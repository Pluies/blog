Due to an internship in Canada, I might not post on this blog as often as I liked. I already let it without any posts while we were fully in the exams period, but I'll try to resume a normal activity as soon as I come back.

Update: as I'm probably going to learn and work on Ruby on Rails, I might blog about it. We'll see!
