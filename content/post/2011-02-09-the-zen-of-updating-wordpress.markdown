Wordpress automatic updates never work.

No matter if it's a major version change or just a small bump (let's say... 3.0.4 to 3.0.5, uh?), I always end up downloading the whole thing and updating it manually because the update page stops responding and plainly goes blank.

Instructions for update are [here](http://codex.wordpress.org/Updating_WordPress), by the way. And after the steps to update, they include that little snippet of wisdom:


<blockquote>Consider rewarding yourself with a blog post about the update, reading that book or article you've been putting off, or simply sitting back for a few moments and letting the world pass you by.</blockquote>



How could anyone be angry at Wordpress after that?
